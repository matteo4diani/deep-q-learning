        "This notebook contains a replication of results in [\"Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning\"](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14236), [\"Playing Atari with deep reinforcement learning\"](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/playing-atari-with-deep-reinforcement-learning), and [\"Deep reinforcement learning with Double Q-Learning\"](\n",
        "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1509.06461) by Google DeepMind members and collaborators.\n",
        "\n",
        "The critical innovation in these papers is predicting the Q-Values for the game at hand (needed for the loss calculations of the player agent network) with a neural network (called _target network_, hence the name _Deep_ Q-Learning) that copies its weights (with a set periodicity represented by the __TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ__ constant) from the _online network_ that plays the game by choosing actions at each time-step.\n",
        "\n",
        "The _online_ and _target_ networks share the same architecture and differ only in their weights (_target_ lags behind _online_ until updated every __TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ__ steps).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Double Q-Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "A _Double Q-Network_ uses the player agent (online) network to compute its own loss function: best Q-Values indices are drawn from the online network (as indices in the Q-Values tensor correspond to actions, this phase can be seen as action selection) but the actual Q-Values for the actions are predicted using the _target network_, as previously defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation details\n",
        "\n",
        "The preprocessing steps detailed in the papers (convert to gray-scale, frame-stacking, etc.) are implemented in the ___deep-q-learning-utils___ repository: a collection of PyTorch and OpenAI Baselines wrappers by GitHub user __@brtorch__.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Deep Q Learning on Atari games produce memory-heavy models, thus we serialize weights to disks so we can resume training after OOM events (set __RELOAD_PARAMS__ constant to __True__).\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation uses a GPU with CUDA if available.\n",

        "8. Training generates logs that are graphed automatically by TensorBoard: run the `Graphs with TensorBoard` cell to generate graphs.\n",
        "9. While the model is training (if `SAVE_PARAMS` is `True`) it saves its parameters to `SAVE_PATH`. If you want to observe the trained model play you can use the `observe.py` script on your local machine (download the `atari_model.pack` file and place it in the same folder as `deep-q-learning-utils`). Google Colab does not support `env.render()` so this must be done on local."
